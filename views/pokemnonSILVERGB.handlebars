            <img class="thumbnail" src="pokemonsilverthumbnail.jpg">
            <p> PokÃ©mon Gold Version and PokÃ©mon Silver Version are 1999 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. They are the first installments in the second generation of the PokÃ©mon video game series. They were released in Japan in 1999, Australia and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. PokÃ©mon Crystal, an enhanced version, was released a year later in each region. In 2009, on the 10th anniversary of Gold and Silver, remakes titled PokÃ©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver were released for the Nintendo DS.

The games introduce 100 new species of PokÃ©mon and follow the progress of the player character in their quest to master PokÃ©mon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between these games and their predecessors in order to fully complete each games' PokÃ©dex. The Johto Saga of the PokÃ©mon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games.

PokÃ©mon Gold and Silver were critically acclaimed upon release. They are considered by some to be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the most significant games of the fifth generation of video game consoles, despite some criticism for its lack of plot. They continued the enormous success of PokÃ©mon Red and Blue as PokÃ©mon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of Red and Blue, and by 2010 had gone on to sell over 23 million units making them the best-selling games for the Game Boy Color and the third-best-selling for the Game Boy family of systems/p>
