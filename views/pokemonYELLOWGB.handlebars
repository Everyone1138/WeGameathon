            <h3>Pok√©mon Yellow Version</h3>
            <img class="thumbnail" src="pokemonyellowthumbnail.jpg">
            <p>Pok√©mon Yellow Version: Special Pikachu Edition,[a] more commonly known as Pok√©mon Yellow Version or Pok√©mon Yellow, is a 1998 role-playing video game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is an enhanced version of Pok√©mon Red and Blue and is part of the first generation of the Pok√©mon video game series. It was first released in Japan on September 12, 1998, in Australia and North America in 1999 and in Europe in 2000. Along with the release of Pok√©mon Yellow, a special edition yellow Pok√©mon-themed Game Boy Color was also released. Pok√©mon Yellow is loosely based on the anime.

Remakes of Pok√©mon Yellow, titled Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, were released for the Nintendo Switch in 2018, the 20th anniversary of Yellow's release in Japan. Pok√©mon Yellow is an enhanced version of the Game Boy games Pok√©mon Red and Blue.[1] Like its predecessors, it is a third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and a menu interface, in which the player configures their party of Pok√©mon, items, or gameplay settings. The player uses their Pok√©mon to battle other Pok√©mon. When the player encounters a wild Pok√©mon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pok√©mon. During a battle, the player may select one of up to four moves for their Pok√©mon to use, use an item, switch their active Pok√©mon, or attempt to flee. Pok√©mon have health points (HP); when a Pok√©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pok√©mon faints, the player's Pok√©mon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pok√©mon will level up. A Pok√©mon's level dictates its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.

Catching Pok√©mon is another essential element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pok√©mon, the player may throw a Pok√© Ball at it. If the Pok√©mon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pok√©mon and the type of Pok√© Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Pok√© Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the Pok√©dex, a comprehensive Pok√©mon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures. Pok√©mon Yellow allows players to trade Pok√©mon between two cartridges via a Game Link Cable, including the previous games Pok√©mon Red and Blue. This method of trading must be done to fully complete the Pok√©dex, since each of the games has version-exclusive Pok√©mon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pok√©mon team. </p>
